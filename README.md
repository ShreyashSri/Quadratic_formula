This project is a simple implementation of the Quadratic Formula Solver. The quadratic formula is used to find the roots of a quadratic equation, which is an equation of the form.
Accepts input values for a, b, and c and calculates both real and complex roots of the quadratic equation.</br> 
Handles cases where:</br>
  --->Discriminant (bÂ² - 4ac) is positive: Two real solutions</br>
  --->Discriminant is zero: One real solution</br>
  --->Discriminant is negative: Two complex solutions</br>
[Points to be noted while entering equation]</br>
"1". x^2 should be written as xx</br>
"2". under root values in equation should be written as 2**1/2(e.g)</br>
