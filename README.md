This project is a simple implementation of the Quadratic Formula Solver. The quadratic formula is used to find the roots of a quadratic equation, which is an equation of the form.
Accepts input values for a, b, and c and calculates both real and complex roots of the quadratic equation.
Handles cases where:
  --->Discriminant (bÂ² - 4ac) is positive: Two real solutions
  --->Discriminant is zero: One real solution
  --->Discriminant is negative: Two complex solutions
